# Authorship Attribution of Arabic Texts using the Deep Impostors Method

## 📌 Project Overview
Authorship attribution in Arabic texts poses significant challenges due to the language’s rich morphology, stylistic diversity, and historical variation. This project presents an adaptation of the Deep Impostors methodology for Arabic authorship attribution, inspired by prior research on literary texts in other languages. The proposed framework leverages contextual embeddings generated by AraBERT and employs impostor-based comparisons to capture stylistic behaviour across document segments. By transforming texts into stylometric signals and analysing their similarities, the approach aims to distinguish between authentic and non-authentic works attributed to a specific author.

## 🧠 Research Motivation
Authorship attribution in Arabic poses significant challenges due to:
- Rich morphology and clitic attachment  
- Orthographic variation and lack of diacritics  
- Stylistic diversity across authors and historical periods  

Most existing computational approaches rely on closed-set classification and are often optimized for modern Arabic texts. This project explores the suitability of the **Deep Impostors framework** for Arabic authorship attribution, aiming to provide a more robust and stylistically focused alternative.

## 🏗️ Methodology Summary
The proposed research framework follows these main stages:

1. Arabic text preprocessing and normalization  
2. Segmentation of texts into fixed-length batches  
3. Contextual embedding extraction using **AraBERT**  
4. Impostor-based binary classifier training  
5. Segment-level stylistic decision generation  
6. Stylometric signal construction  
7. Signal comparison using **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)**  
8. Anomaly detection and clustering for authorship attribution  

The final authorship attribution decision is based on the consistency of stylistic signals relative to impostor authors.
