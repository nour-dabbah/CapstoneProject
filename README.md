# Authorship Attribution of Arabic Texts using the Deep Impostors Method

## 📌 Project Overview
Authorship attribution in Arabic texts poses significant challenges due to the language’s rich morphology, stylistic diversity, and historical variation. This project presents an adaptation of the **Deep Impostors methodology** for Arabic authorship attribution, inspired by prior research on literary texts in other languages. The proposed framework leverages **contextual embeddings generated by AraBERT** and employs **impostor-based comparisons** to capture stylistic behaviour across document segments. By transforming texts into **stylometric signals** and analysing their similarities, the approach aims to distinguish between **authentic and non-authentic works** attributed to a specific author.

This repository accompanies **Final Project – Phase A** at Braude College of Engineering and focuses on the **research framework and system design** of the proposed approach.

## 🧠 Research Motivation
Authorship attribution in Arabic is a complex task due to the linguistic and stylistic properties of the language. Rich morphology, clitic attachment, orthographic variation, and stylistic diversity across authors and historical periods introduce challenges that limit the effectiveness of many existing computational approaches. Most prior work relies on closed-set classification and focuses primarily on modern Arabic texts. This project explores the suitability of the **Deep Impostors framework** as a robust alternative for Arabic authorship attribution through relative stylistic comparison.

## 🏗️ Methodology Summary
The proposed research framework follows these main stages:

1. Arabic text preprocessing and normalization  
2. Segmentation of texts into fixed-length batches  
3. Contextual embedding extraction using **AraBERT**  
4. Impostor-based binary classifier training  
5. Segment-level stylistic decision generation  
6. Stylometric signal construction  
7. Signal comparison using **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)**  
8. Anomaly detection and clustering for authorship attribution
